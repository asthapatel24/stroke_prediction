Here is where you include:

## Background on your code files
  - The project consist of Jupyter notebook with its data in the repository.
  - In this project majorly sklearn and SNS library was used which can be easily imported in Jupyter notebook 
  
## Set up Kaggle notebook
  - Go to https://www.kaggle.com/ and select the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
  - The dataset page will breifly describe the metadata, number of rows and columns.
  - To strat the work on dataset we can go to Task panel and browse the types of task on which we want to work using machine leaning algorithm or data visualization.
  - We can also create a new task if you want to work other than the available tasks.
  - To create kaggle notebook select the New Notebook button as shown in the below figure and it will create a New Notebook.
  - The Notebook is very similar to jupyter notebook there are 2 available languages you can use in the notebook and that can be selected from File > Language > R / Python.

## Results, interpretation and reflection
- The models trained for this problem has return closely similar accuracy.
- I can say Random Forest is best suitable for this problem from the Train score : 0.95,Test score: 0.95 and overall Accuracy: 95.31.
- Both Random forest and Linear regression has very similar result in overall accuracy and in confusion mertics except its test score results.
- As per this result I can conclde random forest can better classify whether a person will have the stroke or not.
