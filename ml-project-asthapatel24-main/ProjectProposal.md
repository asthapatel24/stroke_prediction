# Project proposal for *Stroke Prediction*
Author: *Aastha Patel*

## 1. Why: Question/Topic being investigated 1pt
I'm interested to work upon kaggle task - predict possibilities of stroke from stroke prediction dataset.

## 2. How: Plan of attack 1pt
I've found the dataset contain class imbalance for feature and target so I plan to work upon that and then i'll be working of preprocessing and EDA of the data. Further if i'll get the chance will compare the result with existing task results.

## 3. What: Dataset, models, framework, components 2pts
- Dataset link : https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
- Models : Random forest,Logistic regression and K nearest neighbours 
- Framwork : Kaggle notebook
- Components : Libraries - scikit learn for models, seaborn for EDA, pandas and numpy for data preprocessing
